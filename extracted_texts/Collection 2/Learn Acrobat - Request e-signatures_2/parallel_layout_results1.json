    "title": "Why validate a digital signature?",
    "text": "When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature to verify the \nsigner and the signed content. Depending on how you’ve configured your application, \nvalidation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the \nauthenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity. To verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are\ntrusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or \nAcrobat Reader settings. To verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after \nsigning. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes.",

In the 'Signature Verification Preferences' dialog that opens, you can control the\nfollowing settings: • \nSet automatic validation of signatures: With the Verify signatures when the\ndocument is opened check box selected, Acrobat automatically validates all \nsignatures in a PDF when you open the document. • \nSet verification behavior: The options specify methods that determine \nwhich plug-in to choose when verifying a signature. The appropriate plug-in\nis often selected automatically. Contact your system administrator about \nspecific plug-in requirements for validating signatures. • \nCheck the revocation status of certificates: With the Require certificate \nrevocation checking to succeed... checkbox selected, Acrobat checks \ncertificates against a list of excluded certificates during validation. If you \ndeselect the check box, the revocation status for Acrobat Approval signatures is ignored. The revocation status is always checked to certify\nsignatures. • \nUse expired timestamps: The option is selected by default. It uses the time\nmentioned in the timestamp or embedded in the signature, even if the \nsignature’s certificate has expired. If you deselect the check box, Acrobat \ndiscards expired timestamps. • \nSet verification for time: You can select the appropriate options under \n'Verification time' to check the time at which the signature was created, to \ncheck the timestamp embedded in the signature, or to check the current \ntime. • \nAdd verification information: Select appropriate options under 'Verification\ninformation' to add verification information to the signed PDF or to alert the \nuser when the verification information is too large. • \nConfigure to trust the root certificates in the Windows® certificate store: \nYou can specify whether to trust all root certificates in the Windows® \nCertificates store for: • \nValidating signatures: Certificates are trusted for Acrobat Approval\nsignature validation. • \nValidating certified documents: Certificates are trusted for \ncertification signature validation.
