    "text": "Use the generative AI features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader to quickly scan through\nlengthy, complex PDF content and get answers or generate a summary. Note: The generative AI features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader support English, French,\nGerman, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, or Japanese. To understand the governing terms, \nreview Adobe's Generative AI User Guidelines. To understand Adobe's data handling \npractices, see Content usage and handling practices. The AI-powered features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader support multiple document types,\nincluding PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, and RTF files. AI Assistant supports Microsoft Teams and\nZoom meeting transcripts. The capabilities improve comprehension and save time across \nvarious document types. AI Assistant quickly gets answers to your questions based on your documents in a \ncomprehensive and informative way. It can analyze multiple documents to uncover \nsimilarities, differences, and key patterns. With AI Assistant, you can make targeted requests, \nsuch as highlighting the differences between PDF contracts. It links to text and data table \nsources within the document. It also suggests follow-up questions for you based on the \nprimary question. AI Assistant uses the latest AI language model, GPT 4o, to provide more \naccurate and clear answers to your queries based on more citations. It can extract information\naccurately from tables and complex documents. Generative summary automatically provides an outline with headings and summaries to \nhighlight key points in the document. The feature generates key insights that help you easily\ncomprehend the PDF content. For a speedier response, it processes PDF content in chunks \nand simultaneously streams summaries. You can access the generative AI features in Adobe Acrobat Reader, Adobe Acrobat desktop\non both Windows and macOS, on Acrobat online, and within Acrobat extensions for Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. AI Assistant is also available on phones through Acrobat mobile\napps (iOS and Android). It isn't available on iPad or Android tablets.",

Do not use generative AI features to seek legal, medical, financial, or other kinds of \nprofessional advice or any opinions, judgments, or recommendations without conducting\nyour own independent consultation or research.

However, because the AI Assistant is \npowered by generative AI models, and the technology is still evolving and not perfect, not all \nanswers are helpful or accurate. As a result, the AI Assistant may not find and display answers \nto your questions — even when the information is in your document. And rarely, the AI \nAssistant may provide incorrect attributions. For example, you may receive a clickable citation\nor cue that takes you to an unrelated section instead of providing helpful information on \nwhere the answer came from in the document. Please double-check all AI-generated \nresponses. Please note that in our current version, if the language of the question and response is \ndifferent than the language of your document, AI Assistant won't provide any attribution.
