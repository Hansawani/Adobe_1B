    "title": "What’s the best way to create a PDF?",
    "text": "You can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign® \nfiles, digital images, and more. Diﬀerent types of sources have diﬀerent tools available for PDF\nconversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in \nthe Print dialog box. If a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft \nExcel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is \nalready open, you don’t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. Every PDF balances eﬃciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the\nbalance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an \nappropriate conversion method. For example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat \napplies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings.\nIf you want more control over the process, you’ll want to use another method.",

    "title": "Balance PDF file size and quality",
    "text": "You can select various settings to ensure that your PDF has the best balance between file size,\nresolution, conformity to specific standards, and other factors. The settings you select depend\non your goals for the PDF that you are creating. For example, a PDF intended for high-quality commercial printing requires diﬀerent settings than a PDF intended only for onscreen viewing \nand quick downloading over the Internet. Once selected, these settings apply across PDFMaker, Acrobat, and Acrobat Distiller. However, some settings are limited to specific contexts or file types. For example, PDFMaker \noptions can vary among the diﬀerent types of Microsoft Oﬃce applications. For convenience, you can select one of the conversion presets available in Acrobat. You can \nalso create, define, save, and reuse custom presets that are uniquely suited to your purposes. For scanned documents, you can choose from Autodetect Color Mode or several scanning \npresets that are optimized for scanning documents and images in color or black and white. \nYou can modify these presets or use your own custom scanning settings. There are various ways to create a PDF file using Acrobat. You can generate a PDF quickly \nusing the convert to PDF tool, menu commands, dragging-and-dropping files onto the \nAcrobat application icon, or converting clipboard data.",
