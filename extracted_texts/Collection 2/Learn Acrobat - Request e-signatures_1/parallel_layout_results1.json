    "text": "Many business transactions, including financial, legal, and other regulated transactions,\nrequire high assurance when signing documents. When documents are distributed \nelectronically, it's important that recipients can: • \nVerify document authenticity—confirming the identity of each person who signed the\ndocument • \nVerify document integrity—confirming that the document has not been altered in \ntransit Certificate-based signatures provide both of these security services. Many businesses and \ngovernments have chosen to set up a certificate-based digital signature infrastructure within \ntheir organization. They use third-party certificate authorities to provide independent identity\nvalidation. Examples include: For instance, companies in the European Union who need to comply with advanced or \nqualified electronic signature requirements in eIDAS e-signature regulation or the ETSI PAdES\nstandard (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures).",

    "text": "A certificate-based signature, like a conventional handwritten signature, identifies the person \nsigning a document. Unlike a handwritten signature, a certificate-based signature is difficult to\nforge because it contains encrypted information that is unique to the signer. It can be easily \nverified and informs recipients whether the document was modified after the signer initially \nsigned it. To sign a document with a certificate-based signature, you must obtain a digital ID or create a \nself-signed digital ID in Acrobat or Acrobat Reader. The digital ID contains a private key and a\ncertificate with a public key, and more. The private key is used to create the certificate-based signature. The certificate is a credential that is automatically applied to the signed document.\nThe signature is verified when recipients open the document. When you apply a certificate-based signature, Acrobat uses a hashing algorithm to generate a\nmessage digest, which it encrypts using your private key.
